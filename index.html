      &emsp;Hi guys! I am Jennifer Diloy, but you can call me Jenny.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      &emsp;My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 21, which is all about the C programming language. My laboratory instructor made this course really fun and challenging. I enjoyed all the exercises and projects that I did in that course.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      &emsp;My favorite GE so far is WIKA 1. Although I have already valued my mother tongue before taking this course, it made me realize more how a lot of Philippine languages are in the verge of being extinct since there are only a few countable native speakers of these languages. I learned a lot more about the Filipino language through this course, which made me cherish our language more.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      &emsp;My favorite programming language so far, as I have mentioned above, is C language. I like the way how it is user-friendly but not too user-friendly like python. The use of pointers in programming was really challenging and I enjoyed it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      &emsp;I love eating so I have lots of favorite food. But if I were to pick my most favorite food, it would be dad's buttered shrimp. I think this one's neck-a-neck with sinigang na hipon.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      &emsp;I have a lot of hobbies or things that I want to do but I can't seem to find the way to do all of them. I enjoy reading novels. I love binge watching films, series, and K-dramas. I like listening to music, singing, dancing, traveling, and photography.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      &emsp;My childhood dream was to be a performer. I wanted to sing and dance in front of an audience, and I still want to. I just can't because back then I thought I was just mediocre and right now, I think it's too late for me and I have to be practical in life.
